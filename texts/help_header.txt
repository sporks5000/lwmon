LWmon (Less Worry Monitor) - A script to organize and consolidate the monitoring of multiple servers. With LWmon you can run checks against multiple servers simultaneously, starting new jobs and stopping old ones as needed without interfering with any that are currently running. All output from the checks go by default to a single terminal window, allowing you to keep an eye on multiple things going on at once.
