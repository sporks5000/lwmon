LWMON FILES AND DIRECTORIES

./lwmon.conf
    - This is the main configuration file for LWmon

./lwmon.conf.old
    - If the installation process has updated a previous configuration file to match the new version, the old configuration file will be stored here

./lwmon.log
    - The log file for the master process. Child processes also log some details to this file

./lwmon.sh
    - The main lwmon.sh script

./.lwmon/
    - LWmon's working directory

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/
    - The working directory for a specific LWmon child process

./.lwmon/die
    - Creating this file tells the LWmon master process to exit out cleanly

./.lwmon/lwmon.pid
    - This is the process ID of the current LWmon master process

./.lwmon/new/
    - This directory is where LWmon control processes will place new jobs so that they can wait for the master process to start them up

./.lwmon/no_output
    - When this file is present, the child processes will not output status information for the checks that they perform

./.lwmon/old_[CHILD PID]_[EPOCH TIMESTAMP]
    - This is the working directory of an old LWmon child process, archived temporarily in case data from it is needed

./.lwmon/save
    - Having this file present while the LWmon master process is exiting tells it to save all child processes so that they will start again next time a master process is started

./includes
    - A directory containing additional files of bash functions

./modules
    - A directory containing additional perl modules

./scripts
    - A directory containing additional scripts that LWmon relies on

./texts
    - A directory containing text files for the help and version documentation

./version
    - A directory for verifying that the version present is up to date

./version/conf
    - Contains the version of the configuration file.

./version/version
    - Contains the md5hash of the download of the current verson of the file

./version/version_check
    - Contains the timestamp of the last time the version was checked


FILES FOR LWMON CHILD PROCESSES

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/
    - The working directory for a specific LWmon child process

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/#die
    - An empty file, present to remind the end user that at any time they can rename it to "./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/die" in order to clearly kill that child process

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/#status
    - This file is present to remind the end user that at any time they can rename it to "./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/status" in order to have that LWmon child process output a full status
    - If a full status has been run previously, this file will contain the text of the most recent full status

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/cl
    - The command line arguments to reproduce the child process

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/current_verbose_output.txt
    - This file captures the curl verbose output for "--url" monitoritoring job. 

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/die
    - If an LWmon child process sees this file present in its working directory, it will output a full status to "./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/#status" and then exit

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/force_failure
    - Having this file present will cause an LWmon child process to interpret its next attempt as a failure, regardless of what it would have been otherwise

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/force_partial
    - Having this file present will cause an LWmon child process to interpret its next attempt as a partial success, regardless of what it would have been otherwise

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/force_success
    - Having this file present will cause an LWmon child process to interpret its next attempt as a success, regardless of what it would have been otherwise

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/log
    - This is the log file for a specific child process

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/params
    - These are the parameters for the child process. Editing this file will change the operation of the child process
    - Run `./lwmon.sh --help params-file` for more details

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/previous_verbose_output.txt
    - When a new check for a "--url" monitoring job runs, the "./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/current_verbose_output.txt" file is moved to this location in case the data is needed.

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/site_current.html
    - For a "--url" job, this file will contain the most recent curl of the site being monitored

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/site_[EPOCH TIMESTAMP]_fail.html
    - For a "--url" job, these files show the result of the first failure after any other status

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/site_previous.html
    - For a "--url" job, this file will contain the previous curl of the site.

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/site_[EPOCH TIMESTAMP]_psuccess.html
    - For a "--url" job, these files show the result of the first partial success after a success, or the last partial success before a failure

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/site_[EPOCH TIMESTAMP]_success.html
    - For a "--url" job, these files show the result of the last success before any other status

./.lwmon/[CHILD PID]/status
    - Creating this file will tell an LWmon child process to output the full status on its next check
